# CS294-082-Project

This publication delves into my attempts of implementing two separate Machine Learning models with the help of a Random Forest model and a CNN model to actively attempt to classify astronomical images of supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey.

Further description of the project is mentioned in the Project pdf.

- main.ipynb is used to calculated MEC values, plot Capacity Progression, and plot Accuracy vs Quantization.
- SN_CNN_Model.ipynb is the CNN model used for the project.
- helper.py is a helper file for SN CNN Model.ipynb
- data.zip found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w3GaapM-8z-Do04s-wheMjUVksK0hKJN/view?usp=sharing) contains the data for the autoscan features mentioned in the project.
